For example, there is now the possibility that one node can play the other two off each other for some gain or benefit. There is also the possibility that the relationship between two nodes (A-B) is strained because of the relationship to the third node (A likes C but B does not). The question is what kind of rules of interaction do we see in our friendship and advice networks. We also want to know if the triadic rules for friendship are different (or similar) to the triadic rules for advice. We first discuss the triad census before moving to transitivity."

There are a number of things one could highlight between the two networks, but one striking difference is in the 030T triad, A-&gt;B&lt;-C, A-&gt;C. The advice network has a much higher proportion of 030T triads than the friendship network, suggestive of an underlying hierarchy of advice less present in the friendship network; where A gives advice to B and C and C gives advice to B and B simply receives advice from others. The underlying hierarchy in this advice relation thus runs: A to C to B, as A influences B and C, C influences only B and B influences no one. Such a pattern of hierarchy does not emerge as clearly in the friendship network. In general, the triads associated with transitive dominance relations (021D, 120D, 021U, 030T, 120U) are more likely to be present in the advice network than the friendship network. Note that we need to be a little careful in pushing that conclusion too far, as the networks have different levels of density (and possibly reciprocity) that may be driving the differences we observe in the triad count. We need to take these baseline differences into account before formally interpreting the triad counts. Here, we will utilize a CUG test to compare the triad census to what we might expect by chance, if people randomly formed ties. We discuss other, more complex, options in future chapters.\nWe use the same cug.test() function as we used above when looking at reciprocity. The main difference is that here we condition the random networks in a different way. In this case we will condition on the dyad census, to see how the counts of the triad census differ above what we expect from a network of the same size, density and dyadic tendencies (i.e., same rate of reciprocity). Our particular question is if different specific triad types show up more (or less) than we expect in a random network, conditioned on those features. To facilitate this, we will first write a function to make it easier to specify the test statistic of interest, here the counts of specific triad types. Our function will take the network of interest, calculate the triad census and output the count of the particular triad of interest. We could also write a similar function to take the weighted sum over a specified set of triads. Here we focus on one triad type at a time.\n\ncount_triads_function &lt;- function(dat, triad_names){\n  # Arguments:\n  # dat: the network object\n  # triad_names: the name of the triad type\n  \n  triads &lt;- triad.census(dat) # calculating the triad census\n  triads[1, triad_names] # grabbing counts of triad of interest\n}\n\nLet’s see how this works before we use it in a CUG test. Let’s focus again on 030T, where A gives advice to B and C and C gives advice to B.\n\ncount_triads_function(krack_advice, triad_names = c(\"030T\"))\n\n030T \n 190 \n\n\nNow, let’s use our function to count the triad type of interest but this time compare the counts to what we expect by chance, in a random network conditioned on the dyad census. We now use the cug.test() function. The main inputs are the network (here for advice), the desired conditioning of the random network (cmode set to “dyad.census”) and the function of interest, in this case count_triads_function. The input to that function is triad_names, here set to “030T”.\n\ncug_triads_advice &lt;- cug.test(krack_advice, \n                              FUN = count_triads_function, \n                              mode = c(\"digraph\"), \n                              cmode = c(\"dyad.census\"), reps = 1000, \n                              FUN.args = list(triad_names = c(\"030T\"))) \n\n\ncug_triads_advice\n\n\nUnivariate Conditional Uniform Graph Test\n\nConditioning Method: dyad.census \nGraph Type: digraph \nDiagonal Used: FALSE \nReplications: 1000 \n\nObserved Value: 190 \nPr(X&gt;=Obs): 0 \nPr(X&lt;=Obs): 1 \n\n\nWe can see that the total number of 030T triads in the observed network is above what we expect in the random network. In all 1000 random networks, the observed count is above that seen in the randomly generated network (P(X &gt;= Obs) is equal to 0). This means that the tendency for A to give advice to B and C and then C to give advice to B cannot be accounted for based simply on the density of advice relations and expectations of reciprocity. We now do the same analysis for the friendship network.\n\ncug_triads_friendship &lt;- cug.test(krack_friendship, \n                                  FUN = count_triads_function, \n                                  mode = c(\"digraph\"), \n                                  cmode = c(\"dyad.census\"), reps = 1000, \n                                  FUN.args = list(triad_names = c(\"030T\")))\n\n\ncug_triads_friendship\n\n\nUnivariate Conditional Uniform Graph Test\n\nConditioning Method: dyad.census \nGraph Type: digraph \nDiagonal Used: FALSE \nReplications: 1000 \n\nObserved Value: 23 \nPr(X&gt;=Obs): 0.136 \nPr(X&lt;=Obs): 0.908 \n\n\nThe story is different for friendship. Here we see that in many iterations the observed value (the count of 030T) is not above that expected in a random network of that size, density and dyad census. Using traditional statistical cutoffs, we cannot be certain that there is a difference between the observed and random expectations. This suggests that the tendency for A to be friends with B and C and C to be friends with B is not particularly strong in the friendship network, at least not above what could have arisen if people randomly formed friendships (conditioned on the density of the network and the reciprocity rate). Let’s take a closer look at the observed values and the values expected under the randomly generated networks.\n\ncug_triads_friendship$obs.stat\n\n030T \n  23 \n\nsummary(cug_triads_friendship$rep.stat) \n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   8.00   15.00   18.00   18.26   21.00   33.00 \n\n\nOn average, the expected count in the random network is 18.26, close to that observed in the true network (23). What if we had considered a different triad type in our friendship network? For example, let’s consider 120U (A-&gt;B&lt;-C, A&lt;-&gt;C). In this case A and C have a reciprocated friendship. They also both nominate B who does not nominate them back. There are asymmetries in such a triad, but from a balance perspective this may not be problematic. A and C are both positively linked and they have positive sentiments towards B. There is thus agreement about a third party (B) from the point of view of A and C, even if B does not consider them friends in return. Let’s do a CUG test on the count of 120U on the friendship network:\n\ncug_triads_friendship2 &lt;- cug.test(krack_friendship, \n                                   FUN = count_triads_function, \n                                   mode = c(\"digraph\"), \n                                   cmode = c(\"dyad.census\"), reps = 1000,\n                                   FUN.args = list(triad_names = c(\"120U\")))\n\n\ncug_triads_friendship2\n\n\nUnivariate Conditional Uniform Graph Test\n\nConditioning Method: dyad.census \nGraph Type: digraph \nDiagonal Used: FALSE \nReplications: 1000 \n\nObserved Value: 25 \nPr(X&gt;=Obs): 0 \nPr(X&lt;=Obs): 1 \n\n\nIn this case, we can see that the observed count (25) is above that expected by chance, and this is the case in all 1000 randomly generated networks. This suggests that a triad based on balanced relations, even if not completely mutual, is observed at comparatively high rates in the friendship network.\nOverall, it would appear that the advice network is built around dominance type relations in a way that the friendship network is not. Individuals give advice in a way that follows patterns of status; where, for example, A gives advice ‘down the line’ to B and C. In contrast, the friendship network, at least in our short analysis, is consistent with balancing relations, where if two nodes are strong friends, they will tend to agree (in terms of liking or not liking) third party nodes, even if that third party does not return the friendship. This was not captured very well in the dyadic analysis, where the reciprocity rates were pretty similar in the two networks.\nTo explore these ideas more carefully, a researcher may want to look at all triad types for each network. As part of this book, we have written an additional function that will automatically do a CUG test for all triad types at once (rather than a single example, as above) and then output a summary table of the results. Let’s read in the function:\n\nsource(\"https://github.com/JeffreyAlanSmith/Integrated_Network_Science/raw/master/R/CUGtest_alltriads.R\")\n\nThe function is called CUGtest_alltriads(). The arguments are dat, the network of interest (assuming it is in the network format), mode, cmode and reps, all directly analogous to cug.test. And now we will use the function on our friendship network.\n\nCUG_test_table &lt;- CUGtest_alltriads(dat = krack_friendship, \n                                    mode = \"digraph\", \n                                    cmode = \"dyad.census\", reps = 1000)\n\n\nCUG_test_table\n\n   triads obs mean_random prop_random_lte_obs\n1     003 376     319.838               1.000\n2     012 366     417.276               0.000\n3     102 143     171.140               0.005\n4    021D 114      44.315               1.000\n5    021U  34      43.671               0.051\n6    021C  35      88.250               0.000\n7    111D  39      73.838               0.000\n8    111U 101      73.562               1.000\n9    030T  23      18.070               0.909\n10   030C   0       6.137               0.003\n11    201  20      29.018               0.026\n12   120D  16       7.661               1.000\n13   120U  25       7.695               1.000\n14   120C   9      15.575               0.040\n15    210  23      12.369               0.999\n16    300   6       1.585               0.999\n\n\nThe outputted table has 4 columns. The first column is the triad type. The second column is the observed count in the network of interest. The third column is the mean count seen in the random networks (under the desired conditioning). The fourth column is the proportion of times where the value from the random network is less than or equal to the value in the observed network. We can use these results to explore which triads are found in higher or lower levels than what we expect by chance."
