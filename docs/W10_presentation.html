It was expected that social_support would have the greatest_impact of these broader system variables. It is believed that attachment_style_mediates the relationship between the ontogenic system level and microsystem/exosystem level variables. Secondary data were used to examine these systemic impacts. The dataset was obtained from the National_Data_Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect. The sample_consisted of 265 women, the majority of whom were African-American and who had a high_school_education or GED. The majority of these women were employed, while others were in school or a training_program at the time of the interview. Over 50 percent_of_the_sample had never been married. A multiple_regression_analysis_was_conducted_to_examine_the_impact of factors from three systems levels on the risk of child abuse. Variables were entered into the multiple_regression equation after they had demonstrated significance in bi-variate analyses with Bonferroni corrections. Mother's age was entered first in this equation in order to control for any potential effect of this variable as it has been shown_to_be_significantly_related_to_risk of abuse. Entered in the second step were the ontogenic variables found to be significant: depression and locus of control. In the third and final step, the microsystem and exosystem_variables found_to_have_a_significant_impact on the risk of abuse were entered: the number of social supports available to the mother, the mother's assessment_of_family_functioning and the frequency of domestic_violence perpetrated against her. Locus of control and mother's depression were demonstrated to be the most important predictors in the equation. Domestic violence_and_social_support were the next most important predictors, with family_functioning becoming non-significant in this equation. This supports the hypothesis that ontogenic variables have the greater_impact in predicting risk of physical abuse. A path_analysis_was_conducted_in_order_to_examine the possible time order and causal_nature of these variables. All variables were included in this analysis. The only variables found to impact the risk of physical_abuse were depression and locus of control. The only route from experiencing childhood_sexual_abuse to the risk of committing child_physical_abuse was through the level of depression currently being experienced by the mother. Mother's locus_of_control impacted the risk of abuse directly as well as through its impact on depression. Risk of abuse was not influenced directly by the experience_of_sexual abuse.
2 This study_analyzes attitudes of area residents toward mineral_extraction and processing in the Northern Great_Plains_region of the U.S. Three major_dimensions of people's attitudes toward energy development are examined: (1) belief in economic_opportunities_provided by development; (2) political effects of mineral development; and (3) concern about protecting the environment. Previous empirical studies of attitudes toward the economic opportunity afforded by industrial_development suggest that there is little or no significant difference in belief in economic opportunity between people who have experienced development and those who have not had such experience. Previous studies, however, have paid_little_attention_to_the_effect type of development might have on attitudes toward economic opportunity. It is, therefore, postulated in this study that type of development also has little effect on belief in economic opportunity. The literature reviewed suggests that attitudes_toward_political_change are not strongly_affected by experience with development. A dominant theme_underlying the expectations about attitudes_toward_political changes accompanying development is the distrust of outsiders by inhabitants of the region. Kraenzel (1955) and Toole (1976) describe numerous_ways in which development of the Great_Plains has been dominated by the eastern establishment, often to the detriment of inhabitants of the region. Since energy development is one more example of development which is controlled_primarily from cities outside of the region, it is to be expected that the political changes accompanying energy development will be like changes experienced by inhabitants_of_the_region with earlier developments. Such changes are unlikely to be perceived as desirable by local people. The theoretical_rationale for expectations of attitudes toward the environment is based substantially on research by Vogt (1955) and Kluckhohn_and_Strodtbeck (1961) which stresses the view that western people_perceive the natural_environment as something to be mastered. It is concluded from these studies that inhabitants of the Plains would favor development_of_natural_resources even if such development resulted in environmental degradation. Surveys from six counties in the region permit an examination of the relationship of these attitudes to the level of development occurring and to political_and_economic_interests in an effort_to_understand better the process_of_social change. A primary_focus of the analysis is the effect which length of experience with development and different types of development have on attitudes. The analysis also focuses on differences among the major economic_interest_groups in rural_communities where mineral development is taking place. Data for the analysis come from studies carried out by researchers at the University_of_Wyoming from 1973 to 1976. The survey instruments were part of social_impact_assessment_studies funded by Atlantic Richfield Company, the Missouri Basin Power Project, and the Old West Regional Commission.

CASA, Community Action Stops Abuse, is the context for this research on the lived realities and meaning of working with an empowerment philosophy. A University-Community Initiative (UCI) grant with CASA and the University_of_South_Florida is the occasion to study the communicative_aspects of individual_and_collective perceptions of empowerment. The dissertation_focuses broadly on two UCI project goals: developing a collaborative relationship and producing a booklet of stories about the work of paid_staff and volunteers. The heart_of_the_dissertation is my relationship with the CASA workers and how scholarship and advocacy intersect with a philosophy of reciprocal and compassionate empowerment. This layered account of my CASA experiences is framed by my observations at the National_Coalition_Against_Domestic Violence conference. The narrative methodology supports a feminist_philosophy that extends the personal and the political to the personal as the theoretical. The CASA workers and I engage in what Kenneth Gergen calls poetic activism, writing or speaking about something in order to cause change, a form_of_communication activism. My dissertation is based on feminist_research principles in the form of engaged_scholarship and participatory_action_research accomplished through participant_observation and interactive interviews, written as ethnographic narratives, life stories, and autoethnographic stories. I coined_the_term research novel because my research data is reported in a creative, narrative_format that integrates the literature review, methodology, and analysis throughout the story. The boundary between analysis and narrative is dissolved with an emphasis on connected knowing, the language of possibilities, appreciative inquiry, strengths-based service, and positive refraining. Rather than oppositional approaches of either/or thinking, my work embraces the ambiguities, contradictions, multiple_identities and blurred boundaries of our lived experiences. The concept_of_empowerment can be ambiguous, particularly for women who are seeking ways_to_redefine_power and empowerment. An area for further study is the connection between empowerment and the framing of vulnerability, including individuals' perceptions of the paradoxical_nature of compassion for self and others.

This study of the perspectives of low-income Indian_families found both professionals_and_parents culturally conditioned into their roles. The middle-class professionals defined parent_participation in terms of parent_education and provided no forum for the parents' input when making decisions about their child's education; in turn, the parents, always aware of their low_socioeconomic status, did not demand the opportunity to be allowed to participate. The study suggests, one, that arguments_based on the Indian values of social duties and obligations, rather than parental rights, will be more conducive to convincing professionals that parents be given a voice, and, two, that, in time, the deliberate and conscious inclusion of parents by professionals in the decision-making process will lead to a more equitable_distribution_of_power in parent-professional interactions.
5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No nationally administered program has come under more fire than our social_welfare system. "Welfare" is now a code word for a national bureaucratic program that is destroying local_community_organizations and encouraging long_term dependency primarily among poor, inner city minority citizens. But criticisms of the welfare_state obscure its true size_and_scope as well as misrepresent its program objectives and outcomes. In addition, such criticisms do not correspond with the actual configuration of the American_welfare_state since services are organized and implemented_at_the_local_level by community and faith-based organizations. Local governments retain jurisdiction over the planning_process as it affects service location, and despite the emergence of the welfare state, its programs_continue to be characterized by four key elements. These include (1) the third party_organizational structure; (2) the decentralized and separate jurisdictions of federal_and_local governments; (3) the fundamental_role of the local_planning process; and (4) the class_and_racial_segregation characterizing American cities. These factors raise an important question: If local_forces continue to regulate the organization of services, what has changed since the emergence of the welfare state? This dissertation_attempts_to_answer_this_question_by_examining the third party organization_of_the_welfare_state and the local_political and geographical constraints placed upon community_organizations that deliver its services. I investigate the functions at the local_level of one particular segment of the welfare state: community and faith-based relief services and shelters provided to homeless people. Using New York_City as my study area, I conduct analyses for time periods before (1920s) and after (1990s) the emergence of the welfare state. Key findings indicate that despite the emergence of the welfare state, community and faith-based organizations continue_to_provide_services while local governments continue to retain jurisdiction over the planning process. The most prominent faith-based organizations_providing_services are those that have broad religious affiliations such as the Y.M.C.A., Catholic_Charities and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. These organizations continue to deliver_services as they did prior to the emergence of the welfare state. However, today the federal_government has a more significant_role in funding distribution--even for these faith-based organizations. Second, the socioeconomic_characteristics_of_neighborhoods where welfare_services locate are very similar to that of the 1920s. In addition, during both time periods, the concentrated presence of welfare_services does not negate the presence of more mainstream_community institutions, particularly churches, schools and libraries.

Meanwhile, the dramatic socio-economic and political improvements by the Taiwanese in the past_ten_years have enabled them to compete with the Mainlanders and thus they have a stronger claim to have the right to promote the status of their language and maintain it. This study_was_designed_and_conducted_in_order_to_investigate whether or not the Taiwanese are experiencing language_shift or language maintenance, with a focus on analyzing its social_and_political determinants. In this study, both survey_and_interview techniques were used for quantitative_and_qualitative measurements of this linguistic phenomenon. From the results of the questionnaires and the face-to-face interviews, evidence of language_shift and the distributions of the two languages were discovered. First, proficiency in Guoyu by the Taiwanese is increasing, while that in Minnanyu is decreasing. Second, Guoyu is used in all domains, even for home communication and religious purpose. Moreover, choices between Guoyu and Minnanyu seem not to have been substantially affected by attitudes toward the two ethnic_groups and the two languages, or by objection to the language policy. More importantly, younger Taiwanese do not demand a one-to-one relationship between Taiwanese ethnic_identity and Minnanyu, and they tend to keep dual Taiwanese_and_Chinese identities, or even replace their ethnic_identity with a national identity. Lastly, to different extents, age, educational level, gender, and region_of_origin are found_to_be_related to language_choice by the Taiwanese. It is predicted that this language_shift will continue, although at a slow rate, and that Minnanyu will temporarily survive on the oral level as a medium serving limited functions, mainly to satisfy partial needs for domestic business exchange, for cross-generational communication with the old (especially those over 60 years old) in the Taiwanese families, and for religion. Eventually, the transformation of the Taiwanese_attitudes towards their own ethnic_identity and their heavy_dependence on Guoyu will bring about the functional demise of Minnanyu.</code></pre>
